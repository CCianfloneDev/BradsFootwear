### CMS Proposal for Brad’s Footwear

Description of the CMS
Currently, only Brad’s close friends know about his excellent sneaker collection, it’s top notch, however I want the whole world to know about his million-dollar collection. And that’s where I come into play with a content management system for Brad to upload ALL his excellent sneakers for the world to view. 

For my content management system for Brad’s Excellent Sneakers, I will build an online catalogue for sneakers, on this catalogue viewing-users can observe a wide list of sneakers that an admin (Brad) may wish to upload. 

Upon selecting a sneaker on the online catalogue, it will display an image of the sneaker, size, information, description, along with an estimated value. (All of this detail will be inputted by the site admin Brad). The site will not implement functionality to purchase said sneakers, it’s purely a source of information on his excellent selection- I’m limiting it to sneakers for simplicity however this model could be scaled for all sorts of clothing and items making it a versatile online catalogue.
